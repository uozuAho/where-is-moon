# Where is the Moon?

Realistically simulate the Moon's position relative to Earth, so that you can
tell where the moon is now, and where it's going to be in the future.

# todo
- make player cam controls sane
- UI
    - add time controls: speed, pause, set date + time
- make the sun visible
- tilt earth
- tilt moon, incline orbit
- rotate moon
- rotate earth
- orbit earth around sun (or simulate)
- the moon's not currently to scale. Why does it look so small from Earth?
    - camera FOV? zooming in makes everything else look huge
- how to credit asset creators?

# later/maybe
- start from space
    - position camera on Earth surface & look up, eg. double click on a city,
      camera goes there and looks up
