# Where is the Moon?

Realistically simulate the Moon's position relative to Earth, so that you can
tell where the moon is now, and where it's going to be in the future.

# todo
- tilt moon, incline orbit
- rotate earth
- incline earth orbit
- add time controls
    - speed, pause
- rotate moon
- orbit earth around sun (or simulate)

# later/maybe
- move player
- restrict up/down look to 90 degrees
- ui: show where player is on 2d earth map
- ui: add compass
- ui: show current lat long
- ui: show the current time
- ui: user can set date and time
- the moon's not currently to scale. Why does it look so small from Earth?
    - camera FOV? zooming in makes everything else look huge
- how to credit asset creators?

- start from space
    - position camera on Earth surface & look up, eg. double click on a city,
      camera goes there and looks up
